ruby-defaults (1:1.9.3.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The Ruby packages in Debian no longer support switching between different
  Ruby versions using update-alternatives. All unversioned binary names such
  as `ruby`, `gem` etc are now provided by the `ruby` package, and will be
  symbolic links pointing to the binaries corresponding to the current default
  version in Debian.
